## Security Advisories

### CVE-2024-XXXX (Fixed in 2.0.0)
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Component**: vnStat command execution
- **Description**: Command injection vulnerability through network interface configuration
- **Impact**: Remote code execution if configuration is compromised
- **Fix**: Input validation and secure subprocess execution implemented

### Performance Advisory (Fixed in 2.0.0)

## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
- Configuration file structure unchanged, but validation is now stricter
- Debug mode is now disabled by default (set `DEBUG = True` if needed for development)
- Some internal function signatures changed (affects custom extensions only)

#### Required Actions
1. **Create config.py**: Copy `config.py.example` to `config.py` if not already done
2. **Review Security Settings**: Ensure `DEBUG = False` for production deployments
3. **Update Docker Deployments**: Use new Docker configuration with security improvements
4. **Check Interface Names**: Validate network interface names match new validation rules

#### Recommended Actions
1. **Update Documentation**: Review new documentation in `docs/` directory
2. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring as described in `docs/SECURITY.md`
3. **Review Logs**: Check application logs for any new warnings or errors
4. **Test Deployment**: Verify all functionality works as expected

#### Optional Enhancements
1. **Reverse Proxy**: Implement nginx reverse proxy with SSL (see `docs/SECURITY.md`)
2. **Systemd Service**: Use provided systemd service configuration
3. **Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation to prevent disk space issues
4. **Monitoring**: Set up health checks and alerting
